# 📚 **Explainify – Text-to-Visual Learning AI**

**🚨 *Problem Statement*** 

Learning complex topics from textbooks, lecture notes, or research papers can be challenging and time-consuming 😩. Most resources rely heavily on text, which:

Can be hard to understand for visual learners 🧠👀

Leads to low retention of important concepts 📉

Requires students to spend extra time summarizing and visualizing key points ⏳

There’s a need for a smart, automated solution that can convert textual lessons into visually engaging, easy-to-understand videos 🎬✨ — making learning faster, fun, and more effective.

**💡 *Initial Solution***

Explainify transforms any text lesson into a visual + audio learning experience. Here’s how it works:

**📝*Text Processing***

Input: any lesson, paragraph, or notes.

Automatically splits text into key scenes or sentences using NLP 🔍.

**🖼 *Visual Generation***

Generates realistic AI images for each scene (DALL·E, Stable Diffusion) 🎨🤖

Adds animations like zoom-in, fade, or slide transitions ✨🎞

**🎤 *Audio Narration***

Converts text to speech using TTS technology 🔊

Synchronizes narration with visuals for smooth comprehension 🎧

**🎬 *Video Composition***

Combines images, audio, and animations into a ready-to-watch video 🖥📹

Adds titles, captions, and subtitles to highlight key concepts 🏷📌

***Outcome:***
A fully automated educational video that turns boring text into a dynamic, engaging learning experience 🚀💡.
Students can understand faster, remember longer, and enjoy learning like never before 🎯📖✨

**👥 Team Roles and Work Allocation**

*1️⃣ Text Processing & NLP*

Role: Convert raw text into structured scenes
Tasks:

Take the input lesson/text.

Split the text into scenes or sentences using NLP (nltk / spacy).

Optionally summarize or highlight key points per scene.

Output scene-wise text for image and audio generation.

Tools:

Python, NLTK (sent_tokenize), SpaCy (optional), Pandas (optional for scene storage)

Deliverables:

A list of scene texts ready for images and narration.

Example: ["Photosynthesis converts sunlight into energy", "It occurs in chloroplasts", ...]




*2️⃣ Image Generation*

Role: Generate visual representation for each scene
Tasks:

Take scene texts from Member 1.

Use AI image generation or free stock images.

Options: OpenAI DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, Unsplash API

Save images locally (scene_1.png, scene_2.png, etc.)

Optional: Apply simple overlays or text highlights on images.

Tools:

Python, OpenAI API, Requests, PIL (Pillow)

Image editing software (optional)

Deliverables:

Scene images ready for video composition

*3️⃣ Audio Narration + Scene Video Clips*

Role: Create audio narration and merge with images for each scene
Tasks:

Take scene texts from Member 1.

Generate TTS audio for each scene (gTTS or ElevenLabs).

Combine scene image + narration into a short video clip.

Add scene titles / captions / small animations (zoom, fade, crossfade).

Tools:

Python, gTTS, MoviePy, PIL (for text overlays)

Deliverables:

Individual scene video clips (scene_1.mp4, scene_2.mp4, …)

*4️⃣ Video Compilation & Final Rendering*

1.Role: Combine all scene clips into a final video
Tasks:

Take all scene clips from Member 3.

Apply transitions between scenes (crossfade, fade-in/out).

Add background music or final audio enhancements (optional).

Export final Explainify video (explainify_ai_video.mp4).

Tools:

Python, MoviePy, FFMPEG (optional)

Deliverables:

Final complete video ready for download or presentation

***🧠 How It Works (Step-by-Step)***

***Step-1:🧾 Text Extraction from Multiple File Formats***

This Google Colab project allows you to upload a file and automatically extract text from various file formats — including .txt, .pdf, .docx, .csv, .json, .pptx, and even image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) using OCR.

•	***Upload the file:***
The script uses google.colab.files.upload() to let you upload any supported file.

•	***Detect file type:***
Based on the file extension, it decides which extraction method or library to use.

•	***Extract text:***
Reads or processes the file:

.txt: Simple read

.pdf: Uses PyMuPDF (fitz)

.docx: Uses python-docx

.csv: Uses pandas

.json: Uses json and pprint

.pptx: Uses python-pptx

.png / .jpg / .jpeg: Uses pytesseract and Pillow for OCR

•	***Display the extracted text:***
Shows the extracted text inside a formatted HTML block for easy reading.

Displays a message if no text is found.

***🚀 Features***:

📄 Extract text from Word, PDF, and TXT files

📊 Read and display CSV and JSON data

🎞️ Capture text from PowerPoint (.pptx) slides

🖼️ Perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on images

⚙️ Automatically detects file type and uses the right extraction method

🧠 Built for Google Colab — no local setup required
